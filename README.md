# Nectar backend network services  are only available by using a proxy.

Nb. The second branch of this project is a github project web site for delivering the proxy.pac file.

The proxy.pac URL is  https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/nectar_proxy_pac/proxy.pac

To connect, you still need to open an SSH Socks tunnel through the bastion hosts (See https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=251004497 )
